# Stateless-app

### Hello, this is my project with Stateless Authentication

This application uses a JwtToken for authentication. This was done in order not to store the authentication object in the memory of our web server, which made it possible to use multiple copies of our application while keeping the standard authentication process

The project was created using these technologies:

* Java 11
* MySQL
* Spring
* Hibernate
* Tomcat 9.0.50 (to run app locally)

**Setup**

To run this project:

* install MySQL
* install Tomcat 9.0.50
* fork this project and clone it
* set properties of your DB using db.properties file
* run this project using Tomcat's local server
